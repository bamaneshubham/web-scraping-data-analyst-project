# 🕷️ Web Scraping and Data Extraction with Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to scrape tabular data from a real website using Python, extract the data using BeautifulSoup, and analyze it using pandas. It's designed as a beginner-friendly mini-project that showcases essential data analyst skills.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## 💡 Key Skills Demonstrated
- Web scraping from real-world HTML
- Parsing and extracting structured data
- Data cleaning using pandas
- Exporting to CSV
- Project organization and documentation

## 📂 Project Structure
```
📓 web_scraping_realworld_data.ipynb  - Main code notebook
📄 README.md                          - Project overview and instructions
📄 requirements.txt                   - Python dependencies
📄 .gitignore                         - Files to ignore in Git
📁 data/output.csv                    - Final scraped data
```

## 📊 Sample Output
The notebook scrapes tabular data from a real website and presents it as a pandas DataFrame. The data is saved as a `.csv` file for further analysis.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch the notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook web_scraping_realworld_data.ipynb
   ```

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Navigating and parsing HTML with BeautifulSoup
- Extracting and structuring real-world data
- Using pandas for data wrangling
- Saving and reusing data in CSV format

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Add visualizations using matplotlib or seaborn
- Automate scraping and run on a schedule
- Store scraped data in a database (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
